# SilvacoToPixelAV

PixelAV perfroms simulations of silicon sensors: specifically the induced charge (as a function of time) in a pixel sensor array for an incident pion with a defined incident angle and momentum. Inorder to perform these simulations PixelAV needs information of electric fields and weighting fields of these sensors which can be produced using an FEM software capable of simulating fields in silicon material. DF-ISE TCAD was used for this purpose in the past for which the simulation results have been verified and accepted. Currently there is interest to simulate the same using Silvaco TCAD. Since the formats involved with Silvaco are slightly different, codes to modify the simulation framework (DF-ISE + PixelAV) to use Silvaco (Silvaco + PixelAV) instead of DF-ISE are needed, and are what is stored in this repository. The simulation framework cycle will look like the following:
Silvaco TCAD simulation -> Parsers (exports silvaco data and converts to a format readable by interpolation codes) -> Interpolation + Alteration (converts to a format required by PixelAV) -> PixelAV simulation.

Additionally inorder to validate the simulation results from the Silvaco+PixelAV framework, a comparison of results from Silvaco+PixelAV with DF-ISE involving the same sensor structure and simulations, needs to be done. validationPlots.py is the python file that does this validation.
